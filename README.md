This repository contains a **from-scratch implementation of neural networks** in Python. The goal is to understand the core concepts of deep learning by building everything from the ground up, including automatic differentiation, tensor operations, and basic neural network layers.

## Introduction
This project is an educational implementation of neural networks, inspired by frameworks like PyTorch and TensorFlow. It includes:
- A custom `Value` class for automatic differentiation.
- Basic operations like addition, multiplication, subtraction, and division.
- A foundation for building more complex neural network components.

The code is designed to be simple and easy to understand, making it a great resource for learning how deep learning frameworks work under the hood.
